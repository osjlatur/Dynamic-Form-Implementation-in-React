 The useEffect hook fetches form fields from the API based on user selection and updates the formFields state. The form is then rendered dynamically based on these fields.
The handleSubmit function validates the form data, checking for required fields and data types. Error messages are displayed for invalid fields.
 On successful validation, form data is submitted to the backend (replace the comment with actual submission logic).
 A success message is displayed after successful submission, along with a tabular view of submitted data.
 Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to ensure the form is responsive across different screen sizes.
 The code handles errors gracefully, displaying user-friendly error messages.
